### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Ben Lee
#### Developer, Artist, Tutor & Skateboard Instructor
At first I was a starving artist. Then I taught myself to code, now I combine them. Now, I'm no longer starving. 

I have 4 passions in life: Art, Coding, Teaching, and Skateboarding.  I've had the privilege to pursue these passions, working as a Designer, Software Developer, Special Needs K-12 CS & Maths Tutor, and Skateboarding Instructor.

Skills: Swift / Objective-C / SwiftUI / REST / Firebase / UIKit / UI Design / Sketch / Teaching / Skateboarding / Special Needs K-12 Mentoring 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
